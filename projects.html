            <h3>BIOSITE</h3>
            <p>This project focused on building a simple website for someone in our personal life.
              I used Visual Studio Code to create a website consistencing of HTML and CSS being able to link
              pages together. I focused on webports and added a interactive transition when you hover over 
              photos. Also, using HTML and CSS validity tools, I was able to test my code making sure everything worked.

            <h3>RPG CHARACTER BUILDER</h3>
            <p>This project focused on creating a single page application using Angular. 
              Using Angular routes and components, I was able to create a single page application.
              I was able to test my application as well to ensure there were no errors in building the site. I was able to use 
              test cases in order to make sure of possible scenarios.

            <h3>IN-N-OUT BOOKS</h3>
            <p>This project focused on creating a landing page. All the other work was using test cases. We 
              worked with HTTP requests such as GET, DELETE, etc in order to prove our code was working. For example,
              I created a login system, but not the physicality of it moreso the knowledge with tokens and keys. I was
              able to then translate that into a server to go live.

            <h3>HONORSBOOK</h3>
            <p>This project focused on building a website for a Univeristy's Honor Program. This was the first ever time I coded
            and I was able to create mulitple pages with different functions. I was able to create a carousel of images for the home 
            page and work with a team to create a login system. Starting out from a team member, I then later became the team lead.

            <h3>PONG GAME</h3>
            <p>This project was one of the many video game projects I created. It is a simple game of Pong that 2 people, 
            or 1, can play on a computer. This was the first Unity project I created. It focused heavily on C coding as 
            well as building the interface.

            <h3>ROSE CAFE</h3>
            <p>This project was a full cycle of designing a website from scratch. From building a moodboard, to selecting
            colors, to creating a sitemap. This project is one of my favorite projects. We even created mockups how a home
            page would look on different devices! This project is my all-time favorite.
